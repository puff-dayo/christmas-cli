# Christmas CLI

## Introduction
`Christmas CLI` is a command-line tool which generates an **animated** Christmas-themed display right in your **Windows** terminal(or cmd.exe).
Let's bring some new year cheer.

## Project Description
- A _beautifully_ rendered Christmas tree with twinkling lights.
- Falling snowflakes animation.
- Customizable greetings and messages.
- Adjustable vertical offset for tree positioning.

Since the script is compiled into an executable for Windows (x86_64), it can be run directly without the need for Python or additional dependencies.
Download `christmas-card-cli.exe` from the latest release.

## Usage
You can run the program directly from the command line, or just give it a double-click. Here's how you can use the different options:

```
Options:
    -t <time>             Time in seconds between each tick. Default 0.15
    -m1 <message1>        Custom message for the top of the screen
    -m2 <message2>        Custom message for the bottom of the screen
    -f <from>             Signature for the bottom message
    -v <vertical_offset>  Vertical offset for the tree. Default 3
```

## Thanks
This program is **much** inspired from ![ChristmasTree](https://github.com/elliot-wasem/ChristmasTree). Thanks you _elliot-wasem_!
